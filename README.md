# R-Markdowns
Demonstration of R-specific coding

Hello! This is my first crack at creating a portfolio that others can look at. If you're looking through these, thank you for taking the time to do so. I've been immersed in R for over a year now, and I'm constantly learning new techniques and features. I love to see the community support behind R as the well as the new packages that are being created to solve problems in this ever-changing world.
